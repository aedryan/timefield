# timefield
A jQuery plugin to enter the time of a thing

Pretty barebones and without any serious UI helpers, originally designed to help anesthesiologists and surgeons correct errors in their more automated timing of things.  I wanted to make something that would work well for a 10-key user that wasn't cluttered with popovers and popups.  

It only supports a 12 hour clock at the moment but I plan to extend it with 24 hour clock options as well as some other stuff like optionally hiding the seconds.
